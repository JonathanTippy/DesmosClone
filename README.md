# Math Evaluator

Status: working on calculator functionality.

Work in progress. 0.0.1 means that this is a prototype which is unfinished. 0.1.0 will be when the application is functional.

The goal of this project is to make a desmos clone, meaning it impliments the main features of desmos:
easy to use (same interface)
, provides common mathematical functionality
, moving graphs based on variables which slide across a given range at a given speed
, etc
 
while being:
more precise (will return to this, using floats for the moment)
, faster
, and allowing local storage of projects. 

There is no plan for online storage.
